# Code Style Guide

## C/C++

For C/C++, the [Linux Kernel Style Guide](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/process/coding-style.html) should be followed, however we aren't that strict about it.

## Rust

Rust should be formated with rustfmt

## Naming

In C/C++, function and variables names use camelCase.
Class/Struct names use UpperCamelCase.
Defines use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE.
